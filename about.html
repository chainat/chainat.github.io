This Sass platform is globally available and deployed to all three major cloud providers.</p><p>I started working in a development team and worked predominantly with Node.js and React. Late 2017, joined the platform team and heavily focused on scaling the platform which includes improving CI/CD, developed internal tools, enhanced deployment process, scaling Redis, removing SPOF of RabbitMQ, maintaining MongoDB in Kubernetes cluster on AWS, GCE, and Azure. During that time I also contributed my development skills to some micro services using Node.js.</p><h3 class="achievements">Technical Achievements</h3><p>Here are some highlights</p><ul><li>Proposed/implemented a solution for masking personal sensitive information by using a one-way data encryption technique so that it can only be viewed by the chat client</li><li>Improved the data consistency between clusters by introduced UUID a primary key. This simplified the data deployment process.</li><li>Proposed, installed and maintained Jenkins as an internal task runner for various jobs in the platform. Recently, it has expanded to cover larger tasks in the platform.</li><li>Using Google Cloud Build for building all Docker images. Recently, has optimised and reduced the Docker build time by 50% by using --cache-from and multi-cpu machine for complex builds</li><li>Orchestrated Redis Sentinel on all environments including a local stack</li><li>Managed Kubernetes clusters on AWS &amp; Azure</li><li>Designed/implemented an in-house deployment system to deploy all services on all clusters. This simplified the deployment process &amp; reduced human errors</li><li>Improved a RabbitMQ messaging mechanism between services by using a single reply queue. It boosts a message throughput from 5k messages/min to 240k messages/minutes. This also increased concurrent sessions from 40 to 400 sessions</li><li>Removed a single point of failure by moving RabbitMQ outside the cluster where we gained the performance and high availability.</li><li>Designed &amp; created a new virtual assistant with unique capabilities for handling both voice and text conversations in the platform. This unique approach significantly changes the company’s product roadmap and allows us to create new extensive products in near future.</li><li>Integrated Google Home to a new virtual assistant developed earlier for demonstrating the capability of handling voice conversation through one of the external voice interfaces. The integration was done by using Google Action SDK in Node.js.</li><li>Identified bottle-neck issues in the platform and created proposals for improving ML queue usage and ML training service. These works are being prioritised and actioned soon. Converted Traefik daemonset to a pod deployment for better scalability of inbound requests. The latest test has shown that the platform can serve more than 1,000 concurrent chat sessions.</li><li>Converted a brain-as-a-service business requirement into a live protected API service. All API endpoints are documented using Swagger.</li></ul></div><div class="content-section"><h3 class="role">SENIOR SOFTWARE ENGINEER (Feb 15 - Feb 17)</h3><h3 class="company">Sungevity Inc., Oakland, California  (worked remotely from Australia)</h3><p>Developed web applications/tools to support a remote solar design system</p><h3 class="achievements">Technical Achievements</h3><p>Here are some highlights</p><ul><li>Rebuilt a lead generation web application (SPA) for a multi-partner platform using Angular</li><li>Have developed various applications using Docker containers</li><li>Been Involving with CI and docker deployment process on AWS</li><li>Developed a proprietary tile map system from a top-down imagery captured by UAV for providing roof snapshot images used in the solar system design process using Python</li><li>Created a map processing pipeline using docker containers on AWS</li><li>Created/maintained unit test with the test coverage more than 70% using Mocha, Sinon, and Chai</li></ul></div><div class="content-section"><h3 class="role">SENIOR PHP/RUBY WEB DEVELOPER (July/2012 – Feb/2015)</h3><h3 class="company">VML Australia, Sydney</h3><p>Developed a variety of backend web applications using CakePHP, Ruby on Rails and NodeJS.
